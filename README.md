A simple tool that lets you apply real-time effects (like background blur, background removal, or custom backgrounds) to your webcam feed and stream it through a virtual webcam that works with platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, etc.

ðŸ”§ Built with:

Computer vision (OpenCV)

Virtual webcam streaming

Frontend + API + Backend architecture

ðŸ’¡ Main Idea: Process webcam frames, apply effects, and send them back as a continuous stream using a virtual camera so apps think itâ€™s a regular live feed.
